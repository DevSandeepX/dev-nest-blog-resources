Web development is the art of creating websites and web applications. It involves **writing code** and using tools to make websites interactive, dynamic, and responsive.

## Why Learn Web Development?

## Basic Technologies

Web development has three core technologies:

1. **HTML** - The structure of your website
2. **CSS** - Styling and layout
3. **JavaScript** - Making your website interactive

function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}! Welcome to web development.`);
}

greet("Sandeep");
